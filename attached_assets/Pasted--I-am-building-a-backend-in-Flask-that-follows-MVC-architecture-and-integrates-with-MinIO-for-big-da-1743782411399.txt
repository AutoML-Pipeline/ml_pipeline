"I am building a backend in Flask that follows MVC architecture and integrates with MinIO for big data storage. The backend will handle an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, enabling users to upload large datasets, process them with Spark, and train ML models.
I need you to generate a well-structured Flask backend with the following features:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Structure (MVC)
Controllers: Handles API requests for ML workflow.

Models: Defines database schemas and ML pipeline models.

Services: Implements core business logic (file handling, Spark processing, ML pipeline execution).

Routes: Defines API endpoints for each step of the pipeline.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Functionalities
‚úÖ Big Data Ingestion & Storage (MinIO)

Users upload large datasets (CSV, Parquet, JSON).

Files are stored in MinIO with structured naming.

‚úÖ Data Preprocessing (Apache Spark)

Read data from MinIO using PySpark.

Handle missing values, outliers, normalization.

‚úÖ Feature Engineering

Extract and transform features for ML models.

‚úÖ Model Selection & Training

Allow users to choose ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Train models on processed data.

Store trained models in MinIO.

‚úÖ Model Evaluation

Compute accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Save evaluation reports.

‚úÖ Data & Model Visualization

Generate and serve charts (matplotlib, seaborn).

‚úÖ Deployment

Serve trained models via REST API.

3Ô∏è‚É£ RESTful API Endpoints
Endpoint	Function
/data_ingestion	Upload and store big data in MinIO.
/data_preprocessing	Perform data cleaning and transformation.
/feature_engineering	Extract features for ML models.
/model_selection	Select the best ML model for training.
/model_training_evaluation	Train the model and evaluate its performance.
/visualization	Generate visualizations from the data.
/deployment	Deploy the trained ML model as an API.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Technologies
Flask for backend API.

Apache Spark for big data processing.

MinIO for scalable storage.

boto3 / MinIO SDK for handling MinIO.

PostgreSQL / MongoDB for metadata storage.

ML libraries: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, etc.

üí° Expected Output:

A Flask backend structured with MVC principles.

API endpoints for the entire ML pipeline.

MinIO integration for scalable file storage.

Python scripts for Spark-based transformations.

Deployment-ready ML model serving.
